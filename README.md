# Polynomial-Equation-Evaluator-Assembly-x86-
This project aims to implement a polynomial equation evaluator that calculates f(x) for polynomial equations of any degree up to degree 9.

1.	User manual
	When you run the code message “Enter your equation” will appear and than you should enter the equation in format such as “X^2+2*X-3” or “X^3-15*X” and also it can have spaces like this  “X^2 + 2*X -3” or “X^3-15*X”
And you can write Multiply as * like ”2*x” or nothing like “2x” you can write X in upper or lower case ,the constants number should write in the last end of the equation enter Enter key ,than the message “Enter x-value” will appear than you can enter x value as (signed integer) 
Than the result of Equation will appear next message “Result=”.
